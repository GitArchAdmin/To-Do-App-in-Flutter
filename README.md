# todoAPP

My first freelance project. I wrote the project in dart using the Flutter framework

## Getting Started

In this program, the client notes whether he has read the prayer on a certain day since 2010, and the program also has a convenient button that marks all the boxes at once. 
You can find it by clicking on the floating button with the menu icon. After clicking, several buttons pop up, 
among which there are buttons that allow you to easily switch to the next day or the previous day by clicking on another button, 
and you can see another button that allows Clint to freely change the Date in the application. With each state change, 
that is, when each tick is checked, the program immediately saves the data to a file, which allows you not to be distracted from the goal.
